{{ content | trim }} A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. Please first provide potential diagnoses, then evaluate each one in sequence, and summarize to output the final answer. Please think step by step, and conduct your reasoning within <think></think> and share intermediate answers within <answer></answer>. Use an alternating reasoning format: <think></think><answer></answer><think></think><answer></answer>until you reach the final answer.
